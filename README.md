## Hey there, I'm Bosco! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ“š Education

I'm a motivated and passionate full-stack developer with a keen interest in software development and artificial intelligence. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and make a positive impact.

I started my first year as an Honours Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo until I later transferred into Honours Computer Science through a competitive process after I fell in love with programming. 
As of October 2025, I have completed my first three study terms, 2A being the most recent. I was very fortunate to have been recruited as an ISA (Instructional Support Assistant) for an introductory computer science course, CS 135 Designing Functional Programs. I am currently assisting in delivering this course to nearly 1000 first-year math and computer science students at UW.
