## Hey there, I'm Bosco! 👋

I'm a motivated and passionate full-stack developer with a keen interest in software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I've recently been deeply invested in studying neural networks and large language models (LLMs)! I am always looking for opportunities to learn and make a positive impact.

## 📚 Education

I started my first year as an Honours Math student at the University of Waterloo until I later transferred into Honours Computer Science through a competitive process. 
As of December 2025, I have completed my first 3 study terms, 2A being the most recent. I was recruited as an ISA (Instructional Support Assistant) for an introductory computer science course, CS 135 Designing Functional Programs. I am currently assisting in delivering this course to nearly 1000 first-year math and computer science students at UW.
